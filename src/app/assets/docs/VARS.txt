For a manufacturing site outside the EU/EEA where an operational GMP mutual recognition agreement (MRA) 
exists between the country concerned and the EU: a GMP certificate issued within the last 3 years by the relevant 
competent authority;

For a manufacturing site outside the EU/EEA where no such mutual recognition agreement exists: a GMP

Notes:

In case of a change in or a new manufacturing site in a country outside the EU/EEA without an operational GMP mutual 
recognition agreement with the EU, marketing authorisation holders are advised to consult the relevant competent authorities first 
before making the submission of the notification and to provide information about any previous EU/EEA inspection in the last 2- 
3 years and/or any planned EU/EEA inspection(s) including inspection dates, product category inspected, Supervisory Authority 
and other relevant information. This will facilitate the arrangement for a GMP inspection by an inspection service of one of the 
Member States if needed.

QP Declarations in relation to active substances
Manufacturing authorisation holders are obliged to only use as starting materials active substances that have been 
manufactured in accordance with GMP so a declaration is expected from each of the manufacturing authorisation 
holders that use the active substance as a starting material. In addition, as the QP responsible for batch certifi 
cation takes overall responsibility for each batch, a further declaration from the QP responsible for batch 
certification is expected when the batch release site is a different site from the above.
In many cases only one manufacturing authorisation holder is involved and therefore only one declaration will be 
required. However, when more than one manufacturing authorisation holder is involved rather than provide 
multiple declarations it may be acceptable to provide a single declaration signed by one QP. This will be accepted 
provided that:
The declaration makes it clear that it is signed on behalf of all the involved QPs.
The arrangements are underpinned by a technical agreement as described in Chapter 7 of the GMP Guide and the 
QP providing the declaration is the one identified in the agreement as taking specific responsibility for the GMP 
compliance of the active substance manufacturer(s). Note: these arrangements are subject to inspection by the 
competent authorities.



 
Applicants are reminded that a Qualified Person is at the disposal of a manufacturing authorisation holder 
according to Article 41 of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 45 of Directive 2001/82/EC and located in the 
EU/EEA. Therefore declarations from personnel employed by manufacturers in third countries, including those 
located within MRA partner countries are not acceptable.

According to Article 46a(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 50a(1) of Directive 2001/82/EC, manufacture 
includes complete or partial manufacture, import, dividing up, packaging or presentation prior to its incor 
poration into a medicinal product, including repackaging or relabeling as carried out by a distributor.

A declaration is not required for blood or blood components they are subject to the requirements of Directive 
2002/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (1).
